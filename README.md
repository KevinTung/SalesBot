## About the Project 
For a toB company to sale its enterprise service, the sales need to communicate with the potential customers effectively.  As each sales are overloaded with customers, they are prone to delayed response and low-quality response.  To evaluate the conversation between sales and customers requires huge labor works from manager and HRs.  Therefore, a sales-assistant chatbot to record, analyze, and visualize the metrics of the conversation comes in handy.
